The application is deployed at [https://frontendip.onrender.com](https://frontendip.onrender.com/#/login).  
Since the user is not logged in by default, they should be automatically redirected to the login page.

Currently, there are four registered users:
- First user:
  - Username: zaposlenik1
  - Password: 12qwasyx
- Second user:
  - Username: direktor1
  - Password: 12qwasyx
- Third user:
  - Username: revizor1
  - Password: 12qwasyx
- Fourth user:
  - Username: računovođa1
  - Password: 12qwasyx

A logged-in user can log out by clicking the button in the upper right corner of the page and selecting "Log out".

Additionally, direktor1 can register/add a new user by selecting this option on the home screen after logging in.

When clicking the "Sign in" button during login or the "Save" button when registering a new user, please wait a few seconds for the process to complete.

> The functionality of the application is demonstrated in the `web app slideshow.pptx` presentation included in this repository.

## About This Fork

This repository is a fork of the original InzenjerskiPristup project and serves as a showcase on my personal GitHub.

### My Contributions

- **Database Design:** I designed and implemented the entire database structure for the application, ensuring data integrity, scalability, and performance.
- **Backend Implementation:** I developed all backend functionality, including API endpoints, authentication, user management, and integration with the database.
- **Documentation:** I wrote the necessary documentation related to my work on the database and backend, providing clear guidance for future development and maintenance.
